{"name":"MAQ PhD","tagline":"For sharing ideas and code","body":"# MAQ_PhD\r\nThis MAQ repository is meant for sharing ideas and code among PhD students and other colleagues within the meteorology department of Wageningen University. Everyone with the link can access the repository. I will give everyone in the department that sends me his github username collaborator rights. Please feel free to add your pieces of code or wiki pages, but try to keep the repository tidy. I will make an effort to keep it structured.\r\n\r\n### The wiki\r\nPlease note the wiki among the different tabs. The wiki contains all kinds of useful information on a load of topics, mostly related to working with unix, programming in python, working with latex, and other computer-related stuff.\r\n\r\n### The code\r\nThe main repository is meant for sharing code, either simple example scripts, or complete routines that may be useful for other people within or outside the department. For example, there could be a piece of Python code related to WRF postprocessing, or a latex template for dissertation design. \r\n\r\n### Working with git\r\nEditing online is possible, but it works better if you clone the repository, edit it locally and then upload the changes. For anyone who is not familiar with git: don't worry. We will dedicate a wiki page to that, all the information you'll need will be there shortly.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
